javascript challenge 


 // This challenege consisted of me making a functioning password generator. To be able to do this I added the functions, strings, arrays, and variables necessary to complete the homework. After answering each prompt on the website depending on the information I give it, will it generate me a password under my terms. Thankfully a friend of mine helped me and guided me throughout the steps when I`d get confused and or stuck.//
